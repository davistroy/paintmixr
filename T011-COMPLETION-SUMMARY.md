- ✅ 100 paints: P95 < 30 seconds

**Metrics per collection size**:
- Min, Max, Avg response times
- P50, P95, P99 percentiles
- Sample count

### 2. Quality Metrics (Per Collection Size)
- ✅ Delta E accuracy rate: 85%+ must achieve ΔE ≤ 2.0
- ✅ Average Delta E across all targets
- ✅ Convergence rate: 85%+ must converge successfully

### 3. Memory Management
- ✅ Memory leak detection (20 iterations)
- ✅ Heap usage tracking (initial, final, increase)
- ✅ Target: <50MB memory increase

### 4. Cold Start vs Warm Start
- ✅ Cold start performance (first run)
- ✅ Warm start performance (subsequent 5 runs)
- ✅ Performance improvement validation

### 5. Realistic Test Data
- ✅ 10 base paints with Kubelka-Munk optical properties
- ✅ Synthetic paint variations for larger collections
- ✅ 12 realistic target colors:
  - 3 skin tones (light, medium, dark)
  - 5 common colors (gray, red, yellow, blue, green)
  - 4 edge cases (very light, very dark, high chroma)

## Metrics Count

**Total Performance Validations**: 48

| Category | Count | Details |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Response Time Metrics | 30 | 6 metrics × 5 collection sizes |
| Quality Metrics | 15 | 3 metrics × 5 collection sizes |
| Memory Management | 1 | Single leak detection test |
| Cold/Warm Start | 2 | Cold vs warm comparison |

**Test Assertions**: 22 `expect()` statements
- 20 per-collection-size validations (4 per size × 5 sizes)
- 1 memory leak validation
- 1 cold/warm start validation

---

## Report Generation

### Console Report (Human-Readable)
Generated automatically in `afterAll()` hook with:
- Response time breakdown (Min/Avg/P50/P95/P99/Max)
- Quality metrics (accuracy rate, convergence rate)
- Pass/Fail indicators (✓/✗)
- Sample counts

### JSON Report (Machine-Readable)
**Output Path**: `reports/enhanced-mode-performance-baseline.json`

**Structure**:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 datetime",
  "test_run": "T011-enhanced-mode-performance",
  "targets": { "5": 5000, "10": 10000, ... },
  "results": {
    "5": {
      "paint_count": 5,
      "target_p95_ms": 5000,
      "response_times": { ... },
      "quality": { ... }
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Test Infrastructure
- Uses Jest with `performance.now()` for accurate timing
- Global state management for cross-test metrics aggregation
- Automatic garbage collection if `--expose-gc` flag provided
- 2-minute test timeout for long-running performance tests

### Mock vs Real Testing
1. **Pre-T028**: Uses realistic mock optimization
   - Complexity-based timing (log-scale with paint count)
   - Delta E range 1.5-3.0 (realistic)
   - 90% convergence rate simulation
   - Variance in response times

2. **Post-T028**: Uses actual `/api/optimize` route
   - Real performance measurement
   - Actual Delta E calculations
   - True convergence validation
   - Production-ready baseline establishment

### Mock Characteristics
- Base time: `200ms × log2(paintCount + 1)`
- Variance: ±100ms random
- Delta E: 1.5-3.0 range (realistic failure rate)
- Convergence: 90% success rate

## Integration with T028

This test (T011) validates the implementation of T028 (enhanced optimization):

| T028 Requirement | T011 Validation |
|------------------|------------------|
| Delta E ≤ 2.0 for 85%+ targets | `expect(accuracyRate).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0.85)` |
| Convergence rate > 85% | `expect(convergenceRate).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0.85)` |
| Response time scaling | P95 targets for 5/10/20/50/100 paints |
| Memory efficiency | Memory leak detection (<50MB increase) |
| Realistic paint data | 10 base paints + Kubelka-Munk properties |
| Realistic target colors | 12 diverse test colors (skin tones, common, edge cases) |

## Expected Test Behavior

### Before T028 Implementation
- ❌ Tests use mock optimization
- ✅ Test infrastructure validated
- ✅ Report generation verified
- ℹ️ Baseline metrics from mock (not production)

- ✅ Actual performance validated
- ✅ Production baseline established
- ✅ Regression detection enabled

## Performance Baseline Targets

From `specs/005-use-codebase-analysis/research.md`:

| Paint Count | P95 Target | Rationale |
|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 5 paints | <5s | Fast optimization for small collections |
| 10 paints | <10s | Standard user collection size |
| 20 paints | <20s | Complex optimization with multiple pigments |
| 50 paints | <30s | Large professional collection |
| 100 paints | <30s | Maximum supported collection size |

**Quality Targets** (Constitutional Principle VI):
- Delta E ≤ 2.0 for 85%+ of realistic target colors
- Convergence rate > 85% across all scenarios
- No memory leaks (<50MB increase over 20 iterations)
