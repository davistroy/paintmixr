# Feature Specification: Deploy to Vercel with OAuth Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `003-deploy-to-vercel`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "deploy-to-vercel: I want to do two major things for this project. One, I want to enable Supabase authentication for Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. And two, I want to migrate this application to the public web on Vercel by having GitHub build and deploy the app each time it is pushed to Github."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: How long should user sessions remain active before requiring re-authentication? ‚Üí A: 24 hours (1 day, balance security/convenience)
- Q: What should happen when a user signs in with different OAuth providers using the same email address? ‚Üí A: Merge accounts - treat as same user, link all providers to one account
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable downtime during deployments? ‚Üí A: Under 5 minutes - extended maintenance acceptable
- Q: Who needs access to deployment logs and status information? ‚Üí A: Developers only - technical team members
- Q: What is the expected number of concurrent users the application should handle? ‚Üí A: 1-10 users (personal/small team use)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a PaintMixr user, I want to access the application from anywhere on the internet using my existing Google, Microsoft, or Facebook account so that I can securely manage my paint collections without creating a new username and password.

As a PaintMixr administrator, I want the application to automatically deploy to production whenever code is pushed to the main branch on GitHub so that updates reach users quickly and reliably without manual deployment steps.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### OAuth Authentication
1. **Given** a user visits the PaintMixr application, **When** they click "Sign in with Google", **Then** they are redirected to Google's authentication page and upon successful authentication are returned to PaintMixr with an active session
2. **Given** a user visits the PaintMixr application, **When** they click "Sign in with Microsoft", **Then** they are redirected to Microsoft's authentication page and upon successful authentication are returned to PaintMixr with an active session
3. **Given** a user visits the PaintMixr application, **When** they click "Sign in with Facebook", **Then** they are redirected to Facebook's authentication page and upon successful authentication are returned to PaintMixr with an active session
4. **Given** an authenticated user with saved paint collections, **When** they sign out and sign back in using the same OAuth provider, **Then** their paint collections and preferences are preserved
5. **Given** a user who previously signed in with Google, **When** they sign in with Microsoft using the same email address, **Then** they access the same account with all existing paint collections intact and both providers linked
6. **Given** a user attempts to access protected features without authentication, **When** they try to save a paint color, **Then** they are prompted to sign in first

#### Continuous Deployment
1. **Given** a developer pushes code to the main branch on GitHub, **When** the push completes, **Then** Vercel automatically builds and deploys the new version to production
2. **Given** a deployment is in progress, **When** a user accesses the application, **Then** they continue to see the current stable version without interruption
3. **Given** a build fails due to errors, **When** the deployment process detects the failure, **Then** the previous working version remains live and the team is notified
4. **Given** a feature branch is pushed to GitHub, **When** the push completes, **Then** Vercel creates a preview deployment with a unique URL for testing
5. **Given** a pull request is created, **When** Vercel finishes building the preview, **Then** the PR includes a comment with the preview URL for review

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user's session expires (after 24 hours) while they are actively using the application? System must prompt for re-authentication without losing unsaved work.
- How does the system handle OAuth provider outages (Google/Microsoft/Facebook unavailable)?
- How does the system handle deployment failures that occur after business hours?
- What happens when environment variables or secrets need to be updated in the production deployment?
- How does the system handle database migrations that need to run before a new deployment is fully functional?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
