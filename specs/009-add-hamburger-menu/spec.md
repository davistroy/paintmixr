# Feature Specification: Hamburger Navigation Menu

**Feature Branch**: `009-add-hamburger-menu`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add-hamburger-menu add a hamburger menu at the top right of the page that has the following options: 1. Session History 2. Debug mode - have an option to toggle on/off a mode that provides extensive logging information about all app actions for debugging purposes. This info would be in a 10 line text box at the bottom of the page that scrolls as messages are added to show the latest 10 lines, but all of the debug info would be saved and there would be a 'Download Logs' option below the logging display that would allow the user to download the log file. 3. Provide an 'About' feature that shows some relevant info about the app including the version number 4. A 'Logout' function that logs the current user out and sends them back to the authorization page where they would have to re-authorize before further use of the app"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: What content should the About dialog display beyond the version number? ‚Üí A: Version number + release date + developer credits + GitHub repository link
- Q: Should Debug Mode state persist across browser sessions/page refreshes? ‚Üí A: No - session-only (resets on page refresh/navigation)
- Q: What qualifies as an "application action" for debug logging? ‚Üí A: All of the above (API calls, user interactions, state changes, errors)
- Q: Where should debug logs be stored? ‚Üí A: In-memory only (lost on page refresh)
- Q: What format should downloaded log files use? ‚Üí A: Plain text (.txt) - simple, human-readable
- Q: What is the maximum size/duration of logs stored in memory before rotation/pruning? ‚Üí A: 5 MB size limit, with FIFO
- Q: Should the hamburger menu have animation/transition effects when opening/closing? ‚Üí A: Yes - smooth slide/fade animation
- Q: What is the expected volume of debug events per second during typical usage? ‚Üí A: Medium (10-50 events/second) - active usage with API calls
- Q: What performance metrics define acceptable Debug Mode overhead when disabled? ‚Üí A: the user will expect a performance degradation so whatever Debug Overhead is reasonable based on the simplest, cleanest implementation of this
- Q: How should the system handle extremely long log messages that exceed screen width? ‚Üí A: Horizontal scroll within the log entry, with a "Wrap Text" checkbox below the console to toggle wrapping
- Q: What happens if the user attempts to download logs when no debug data has been captured yet? ‚Üí A: Disable the "Download Logs" button when no logs exist
- Q: Should the hamburger menu remain accessible when modals or dialogs are open? ‚Üí A: No - disabled/hidden when modals are open

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an authenticated user of PaintMixr, I need a persistent navigation menu to access key application features (session history, debug mode, app information, and logout) from any page without cluttering the main interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** user is on any page of the application, **When** user clicks the hamburger icon in the top-right corner, **Then** a menu appears showing Session History, Debug Mode, About, and Logout options

2. **Given** the hamburger menu is open, **When** user clicks "Session History", **Then** the menu closes and user navigates to their saved session history

3. **Given** the hamburger menu is open, **When** user toggles "Debug Mode" to ON, **Then** a debug console appears at the bottom of the page showing the last 10 lines of application logs with auto-scroll to newest entries

4. **Given** Debug Mode is enabled and logs are displayed, **When** user clicks "Download Logs", **Then** the complete debug log file downloads to the user's device

5. **Given** the hamburger menu is open, **When** user clicks "About", **Then** a modal/dialog displays application version number, release date, developer credits, and GitHub repository link

6. **Given** the hamburger menu is open, **When** user clicks "Logout", **Then** the user session terminates, authentication tokens are cleared, and user is redirected to the signin page

7. **Given** user is viewing the debug console, **When** new application events occur, **Then** new log entries appear in the console with automatic scrolling to keep the latest 10 lines visible

8. **Given** the hamburger menu is open, **When** user clicks outside the menu or presses ESC key, **Then** the menu closes without taking any action

### Edge Cases

- Debug Mode toggled off: All logs are cleared from memory immediately
- Empty log download: "Download Logs" button disabled when no logs exist
- Long log messages: Horizontal scroll by default, optional text wrapping via checkbox
- Modal/dialog interaction: Hamburger menu hidden when any modal is open
- FIFO rotation: When logs exceed 5 MB, oldest entries are removed automatically

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a hamburger menu icon in the top-right corner of all authenticated pages; icon is hidden when modals or dialogs are open
- **FR-002**: System MUST show a menu with four options when the hamburger icon is clicked: Session History, Debug Mode, About, and Logout
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to navigate to Session History view from the hamburger menu
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to toggle Debug Mode on/off via a menu option; Debug Mode state resets on page refresh or navigation (session-only)
- **FR-005**: System MUST display a debug console at the bottom of the page when Debug Mode is enabled, showing the most recent 10 lines of application logs with horizontal scrolling for long messages and a "Wrap Text" toggle checkbox
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically scroll the debug console to show the newest log entries as they are added
- **FR-007**: System MUST capture and log all application actions when Debug Mode is active, including API calls, user interactions, state changes, and errors
- **FR-008**: System MUST store all debug logs in-memory (beyond the 10 visible lines) for download during the current session, with a maximum size limit of 5 MB using FIFO (first-in-first-out) rotation
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to download the complete debug log file via a "Download Logs" button below the debug console; button is disabled when no logs have been captured
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide an "About" dialog accessible from the hamburger menu that displays the application version number, release date, developer credits, and GitHub repository link
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to logout via the hamburger menu, which terminates their session and redirects to the signin page
- **FR-012**: System MUST close the hamburger menu when user clicks outside the menu or presses the ESC key
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain accessibility standards (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, screen reader support) for all menu interactions

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Hamburger menu MUST open/close within 200ms with smooth slide/fade animation, respecting user's prefers-reduced-motion accessibility preference
- **NFR-002**: Debug console MUST handle typical logging volume (10-50 events per second during active usage) without UI freezing or input lag
- **NFR-003**: Downloaded log files MUST be in plain text format (.txt)
- **NFR-004**: Debug Mode performance overhead is acceptable when enabled; prioritize simplest implementation over optimization
- **NFR-005**: Hamburger menu MUST be responsive and functional on mobile devices (tap target minimum 44x44px)

### Key Entities

- **Debug Log Entry**: Represents a single logged application event, including timestamp, event type, message content, and severity level
- **Debug Session**: Collection of log entries captured during a single Debug Mode activation period; resets on page refresh or navigation
- **User Session**: Existing authentication session that must be terminated upon logout
