# Feature Specification: Technical Debt Remediation & Code Quality Improvements

**Feature Branch**: `010-using-refactor-recommendations`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "using REFACTOR-RECOMMENDATIONS.md as input"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: FR-022 specifies integrating an error tracking system but notes budget approval is pending. What is the decision for this feature? ‚Üí A: Defer error tracking integration to future sprint (implement structured logging only for now)
- Q: FR-027 asks for an API versioning strategy. For a personal app with no external API consumers, what approach should be taken? ‚Üí A: Add version headers (`X-API-Version: 1.0`) for tracking only, but no version negotiation or breaking changes
- Q: When dependency updates in FR-011 introduce breaking changes during migration, what is the acceptable response strategy? ‚Üí A: Fix breaking changes inline - address issues as they arise during the same sprint
- Q: FR-023 requires fixing test coverage reporting timeout. If the timeout cannot be resolved, what is the acceptable fallback? ‚Üí A: Keep extending the timeout until it is apparent that there is another issue that is causing it - then investigate
- Q: FR-006 requires CSRF protection on all mutation endpoints. For a personal app with no multi-user sessions, is CSRF protection necessary? ‚Üí A: No, skip CSRF protection - unnecessary for single-user personal app

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT needs to be improved and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (specific code changes, library choices)
- üë• Written for technical stakeholders (developers, tech leads)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **developer maintaining PaintMixr**, I need to **systematically address technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and code quality issues** so that the codebase remains **maintainable, secure, performant, and scalable** as the application grows.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Type System Consolidation**
   - **Given** duplicate type definitions exist in `/src/lib/types/` and `/src/types/`
   - **When** developer consolidates to single source of truth
   - **Then** all imports use centralized types with zero TypeScript errors

2. **Security Hardening**
   - **Given** API routes lack rate limiting and input sanitization
   - **When** security measures are implemented
   - **Then** expensive operations are rate-limited and user inputs are sanitized

3. **Dependency Modernization**
   - **Given** 22 outdated packages including major versions (React 19, Next.js 15, Zod 4)
   - **When** dependencies are updated following migration guides
   - **Then** all tests pass with zero breaking changes in production
   - **And** any breaking changes discovered during migration are fixed inline during the same sprint

4. **Code Quality Improvement**
   - **Given** oversized components (684 lines in page.tsx, 1234 lines in repository)
   - **When** components are refactored to meet 300-line standard
   - **Then** code is more maintainable with clear separation of concerns

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Given** no API caching, query monitoring, or connection pooling
   - **When** performance optimizations are implemented
   - **Then** API response times < 200ms (p95), database queries < 100ms (p95), cache hit rate > 70%

6. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - **Given** no error tracking, structured logging, or performance baselines
   - **When** monitoring tools are integrated
   - **Then** developers have visibility into production errors, slow queries, and performance regressions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when dependency updates introduce breaking changes? ‚Üí Fix breaking changes inline during the same sprint
- How does system handle high traffic during rate limit implementation?
- What if test coverage reporting continues to timeout? ‚Üí Extend timeout incrementally until underlying issue is identified, then investigate root cause
- How are API contract violations detected before deployment?
- What happens if Supabase connection pool is exhausted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### **Category 1: Type System & Code Structure**
- **FR-001**: System MUST consolidate all type definitions into single source of truth (`@/lib/types`), eliminating all duplicate definitions from legacy `/src/types/` directory
- **FR-003**: System MUST replace all 53 instances of `any`/`unknown` with proper types
- **FR-004**: System MUST ensure all components are under 300 lines per file
- **FR-005**: System MUST refactor oversized files (page.tsx: 684‚Üí250 lines, repository: 1234‚Üí600 lines, DE algorithm: 1009‚Üí500 lines)

#### **Category 2: Security**
- **FR-006**: System MUST skip CSRF protection (unnecessary for single-user personal app)
- **FR-007**: System MUST add rate limiting to expensive operations (5 requests/minute per user on `/api/optimize`)
- **FR-008**: System MUST sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS vulnerabilities
- **FR-009**: System MUST use correct Supabase client patterns (route handler client for user operations, admin client only for system operations)
- **FR-010**: System MUST audit and document all environment variables (public vs private)

#### **Category 3: Dependencies & Technical Debt**
- **FR-011**: System MUST update outdated dependencies following migration guides, fixing breaking changes inline during the same sprint
  - React 18.3 ‚Üí 19.2
  - Next.js 14.2 ‚Üí 15.5
  - Cypress 13.17 ‚Üí 15.3
  - Zod 3.25 ‚Üí 4.1
  - ESLint 8.57 ‚Üí 9.37
- **FR-012**: System MUST remove unused dependencies (react-color)
- **FR-013**: System MUST delete orphaned Web Worker code (`/src/workers/`, `/src/lib/workers/`)
- **FR-014**: System MUST fix all React hook dependency warnings (6 instances)
- **FR-015**: System MUST replace `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image />` component

#### **Category 4: Performance & Scalability**
- **FR-016**: System MUST implement API response caching with appropriate headers (Cache-Control, ETag)
- **FR-017**: System MUST implement runtime database query performance monitoring that logs all queries exceeding 100ms execution time with query text, duration, and execution context
- **FR-018**: System MUST configure Supabase database connection pooling
- **FR-019**: System MUST implement SWR (stale-while-revalidate) pattern for data fetching
- **FR-020**: System MUST add performance baselines and regression testing

#### **Category 5: Monitoring & Observability**
- **FR-021**: System MUST replace console logging with structured logger (Pino or similar) for all application logging
- **FR-022**: System MUST defer third-party error tracking service integration (Sentry, Rollbar, etc.) to future sprint. FR-021 structured logging satisfies observability requirements for this feature
- **FR-023**: System MUST fix test coverage reporting timeout by extending timeout incrementally until root cause is identified and investigated
- **FR-024**: System MUST achieve >80% test coverage globally, >90% for critical paths (auth, color, optimization)
- **FR-025**: System MUST implement API contract testing to prevent drift

#### **Category 6: API Layer Decoupling**
- **FR-026**: System MUST create API DTO layer to decouple frontend from database types
- **FR-027**: System MUST add API version headers (`X-API-Version: 1.0`) to all responses for future versioning without implementing breaking changes or negotiation logic

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Type Definition**: Centralized TypeScript type/interface in `@/lib/types`, used across frontend and backend
- **API DTO (Data Transfer Object)**: API-layer type that decouples frontend from database schema
- **Performance Baseline**: JSON file containing p95/p99 metrics for color calculations and optimization algorithms
- **Structured Log Entry**: Logged event with severity, message, context (user ID, request ID), and timestamp
- **Security Policy**: Rate limit rules, input sanitization rules (CSRF skipped for single-user app)
- **Dependency Update Migration**: Step-by-step guide for updating major dependencies with breaking changes
