## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04

- Q: What is the maximum number of paint colors that Enhanced Accuracy Mode should support in a single formula? ‚Üí A: Up to 5 paints (moderate complexity, practical for most users)
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable optimization duration before the system must provide a graceful fallback? ‚Üí A: 30 seconds (balanced approach, allows complex optimizations)
- Q: At what duration threshold should the system display a progress indicator during Enhanced mode optimization? ‚Üí A: 5 seconds (balanced threshold, avoids flashing for quick results)
- Q: Should the system allow Enhanced Accuracy Mode when a user has only 2 paints in their collection? ‚Üí A: Yes, allow it (system uses best available paints, may not achieve Delta E ‚â§ 2.0)
- Q: What is the expected maximum paint collection size that Enhanced mode must handle without performance degradation? ‚Üí A: Up to 100 paints (large professional collection)
- Q: What is the acceptable 95th percentile response time for Enhanced mode optimization requests? ‚Üí A: Under 30 seconds (matches maximum timeout, most requests succeed)
- Q: When Enhanced mode cannot achieve Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 with available paints, how should the system present the result to the user? ‚Üí A: Show best achievable result with clear Delta E value and accuracy indicator

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A professional painter working on a commercial project needs to match a specific color swatch for a client's brand identity. They enable Enhanced Accuracy Mode to get a formula that achieves Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 (imperceptible difference to the human eye). The system analyzes their full paint collection and provides an optimized formula that may use 4-5 different paints to achieve the target accuracy, which they can then mix and apply with confidence.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has at least 4 paints in their collection,
   **When** they enable Enhanced Accuracy Mode and select a target color,
   **Then** the system provides a mixing formula with Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 or displays the best achievable accuracy if the target cannot be met.

2. **Given** Enhanced Accuracy Mode is enabled,
   **When** the system determines that using 5 paints achieves better accuracy than 3 paints,
   **Then** the formula includes all 5 paints with their specific volumes and percentages.

3. **Given** a user selects a difficult-to-match color (e.g., vibrant neon),
   **When** they request an Enhanced mode formula,
   **Then** the system returns the best achievable result with clear Delta E value and accuracy indicator, even if it exceeds Delta E 2.0.

4. **Given** an optimization is running in Enhanced mode,
   **When** the calculation time exceeds 30 seconds,
   **Then** the system automatically falls back to Standard mode and notifies the user.

5. **Given** a user has only 2 paints in their collection,
   **When** they attempt to enable Enhanced Accuracy Mode,
   **Then** the system allows it and provides the best achievable formula, clearly indicating if Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 target cannot be met.

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a color is outside the achievable gamut of available paints?**
  System returns the best achievable result with clear Delta E value and accuracy indicator.

- **How does the system handle optimization timeout in serverless environment?**
  System must complete within 30 seconds or fall back to Standard mode with user notification.

- **What if a formula requires paints the user has marked as unavailable or low volume?**
  System should respect paint availability constraints from user's collection settings.

- **How does accuracy degrade with paint count limits?**
  Users should understand the trade-off between formula complexity (more paints) and practical mixing difficulty.
