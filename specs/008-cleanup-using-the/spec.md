## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-04
- Q: When a user toggles Enhanced Mode OFF while a calculation is in progress, what should happen to the running calculation? → A: Allow calculation to complete, but prevent mode toggle until finished
- Q: When the session save operation fails due to network error, should the user be able to retry indefinitely or is there a maximum retry attempt limit? → A: No automatic retries, user must manually retry each time
- Q: When multiple sessions are saved rapidly (concurrent saves), what should happen if a save is already in progress? → A: Reject new save attempts until current save completes
- Q: When the accuracy warning displays for Delta E > 5.0, should it be dismissible by the user or persist until they take action? → A: Persistent (always visible when Delta E > 5.0, cannot be dismissed)
- Q: For Ratio Prediction, what is the minimum and maximum number of paints a user can mix together? → A: minimum 2 paints, maximum 5 paints
- Q: What should happen if a user tries to predict a color with only 1 paint selected in Ratio Prediction mode? → A: Disable "Predict" button until minimum 2 paints selected
- Q: When a calculation times out (exceeds 30 seconds for Enhanced Mode or 10 seconds for Standard Mode), what should the system do? → A: Automatically retry once with same parameters
- Q: If the automatic retry after timeout also fails, what should the system display to the user? → A: Specific timeout error: "Calculation timed out after 2 attempts. Please try a different color or mode."
- Q: Should the system allow users to save a session when the calculation has timed out or failed? → A: No - disable "Save This Formula" button when no valid result exists
- Q: What range of volume values should be allowed for each paint in Ratio Prediction mode? → A: 5ml to 1000ml
- Q: When testing reveals all critical bugs are fixed (Phase 1 complete), should the fixes be deployed immediately or wait for Phase 3 enhancements to also complete? → A: Wait for Phase 3 (include enhancements like accuracy warning)
- Q: Should Phase 4 (automated E2E tests) be completed before deployment or can it be deferred to post-deployment? → A: Can deploy without Phase 4, add tests post-deployment
- Q: When the accuracy warning link to paint management is clicked (FR-018), should it open in the same tab or a new tab? → A: Modal dialog overlay (no navigation)
- Q: For the success toast notification (FR-004), should it include any additional information beyond "Session saved successfully"? → A: No additional information (simple success message only)
- Q: When a user switches input methods (e.g., from Hex Code to Color Picker), should the previous input value be cleared or preserved? → A: Clear previous input (start fresh with new method)
- Q: Should previous calculation results be cleared when the user switches input methods, or should they remain visible until a new calculation is triggered? → A: Clear results immediately when switching input methods
- Q: For invalid volume inputs in Ratio Prediction (outside 5ml-1000ml range), when should validation occur? → A: On "Predict" button click (validate before calculation)
- Q: What specific validation error message should be shown when a user enters an invalid paint volume in Ratio Prediction? → A: Paint volume must be between 5ml and 1000ml
- Q: Should the system log calculation timeouts and failures for monitoring/debugging purposes? → A: Yes - log to browser console only (no server-side logging)
- Q: When the accuracy warning suggests "adding more paints to your collection" (FR-017), what level of detail should this suggestion include? → A: Educational: "Low accuracy due to limited paint collection. More variety improves matching."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Users need to successfully toggle between Standard and Enhanced color matching modes, save their color mixing sessions with accurate metadata, and receive clear feedback when operations complete.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Toggle Between Matching Modes
1. **Given** user is on the color mixing page with Enhanced Mode enabled by default
2. **When** user clicks the Enhanced Mode checkbox to disable it
3. **Then** the checkbox should become unchecked and Standard Mode should be activated

#### Scenario 2: Save Session with Feedback
1. **Given** user has completed a color mixing calculation with valid results
2. **When** user clicks "Save This Formula" and submits the save form
3. **Then** the save dialog should close automatically and display a success notification

#### Scenario 3: Accurate Input Method Tracking
1. **Given** user enters a color using hex code input
2. **When** user saves the session
3. **Then** the session metadata should show "Hex Code" as the input method

#### Scenario 4: Standard Mode Operation
1. **Given** Enhanced Mode checkbox is unchecked (Standard Mode active)
2. **When** user enters a target color
3. **Then** system should generate a formula using Standard Mode parameters (≤3 paints, ≤5.0 Delta E, <10s processing)

#### Scenario 5: Complete Ratio Prediction Workflow
1. **Given** user selects "Ratio Prediction" mode
2. **When** user selects multiple paints with volumes and clicks "Predict Resulting Color"
3. **Then** system should display the predicted color with LAB and hex values

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user saves multiple sessions rapidly? (System must reject new save attempts while a save is in progress; disable save button until current operation completes)
- How does system handle toggling modes while calculation is in progress? (System must prevent mode toggle until calculation completes)
- What if session save fails due to network error? (System shows error message, keeps dialog open, and allows unlimited manual retry attempts without automatic retries)

  - Input method (color_picker, hex_code, image_upload)
  - Mode (Standard, Enhanced, Ratio Prediction)
  - Resulting formula or predicted color
  - Timestamp
  - Delta E accuracy (for matching modes)

- **Input Method**: Tracks how the user specified the target color
  - Color Picker: User selected from preset or custom color selector
  - Hex Code: User manually entered hexadecimal color value
  - Image Upload: User uploaded image and extracted color

- **Mode**: Defines the optimization algorithm and parameters
  - Standard Mode: 3 paints max, ΔE ≤5.0, ~10s processing
  - Enhanced Mode: 5 paints max, ΔE ≤2.0, ~30s processing
  - Ratio Prediction: Forward calculation from paint ratios

## Dependencies & Assumptions

### Dependencies
- Existing session save functionality (API endpoint `/api/sessions`)
- Existing toast notification system (shadcn/ui Toast component)
- Existing Standard Mode and Enhanced Mode optimization algorithms
- Existing ratio prediction functionality

### Assumptions
- Test results from comprehensive-test-plan-2025-10-04.md are accurate
- No database schema changes required for metadata fixes
- Existing paint collection (22 paints) is sufficient for initial release
- Color accuracy warnings are acceptable UX for MVP (not requiring paint collection expansion)

### Out of Scope
- Expanding paint collection beyond existing 22 paints
- Implementing spectrophotometer integration for Kubelka-Munk coefficients
- Bulk paint import functionality
- Paint categorization system
- Image upload file processing improvements (UI already functional)
- Session load/restore functionality (separate feature)

### Deployment Strategy
- Deployment MUST include all phases: Phase 1 (critical fixes), Phase 2 (validation), and Phase 3 (enhancements)
- Phase 1 fixes alone are NOT sufficient for production deployment
- Accuracy warning (Phase 3) is mandatory for release to set proper user expectations
- Phase 4 (automated E2E tests) MAY be deferred to post-deployment
- Manual testing is acceptable for initial deployment; automated tests should be added afterward to prevent regressions

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Must Address)
1. **Checkbox toggle bug**: Blocks entire Standard Mode feature (50% of matching functionality)
2. **Session dialog UX**: Users may perceive system as broken when dialog doesn't close

### Medium Risk (Should Address)
1. **Input method tracking**: Incorrect metadata reduces session history value
2. **Poor color accuracy**: May frustrate users without warning message

### Low Risk (Can Defer)
1. **Ratio Prediction untested**: UI confirmed working, calculation logic likely correct
2. **Image upload untested**: File processing cannot be automated via MCP tools

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement comprehensive regression testing before deployment
- Add automated E2E tests to prevent regressions
- Display accuracy warnings to set user expectations
- Monitor production logs for any new errors after deployment
