# Feature Specification: Enhanced Color Accuracy Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `002-improve-app-accuracy`
**Created**: 2025-09-29
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Improve App Accuracy - I want to upgrade the resultant color accuracy to have a Delta E of no more than 2.0.  You can mix the colors down to the ml in various volumes and combinations to achieve this - you do NOT have to make all of the paint volumes equal, each paint color in the recipe can be a different volume to achieve the best result possible"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a professional artist or paint mixing professional, I want the paint mixing app to provide highly accurate color matching formulas with Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 so that the mixed paint color is virtually indistinguishable from my target color, enabling professional-quality color reproduction for critical applications like art restoration, commercial painting, and color matching services.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a target color is selected, **When** I request a mixing formula, **Then** the system provides a formula that achieves Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 between the target and resulting mixed color
2. **Given** multiple paint colors are available, **When** the system calculates optimal ratios, **Then** each paint volume can be different (asymmetric ratios) to achieve maximum accuracy rather than equal proportions
3. **Given** I have a specific total volume requirement, **When** the system generates the mixing formula, **Then** individual paint volumes are calculated to the nearest milliliter for precision mixing
4. **Given** a color cannot achieve Delta E ‚â§ 2.0, **When** I request mixing, **Then** the system clearly indicates the best achievable Delta E and provides the closest possible match
5. **Given** multiple equally accurate formulas exist, **When** the system selects a recommendation, **Then** it prioritizes formulas that minimize paint waste or use fewer colors

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no combination of available paints can achieve Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 for the target color?
- How does the system handle very small paint volumes (< 5.0ml) that may be impractical to measure reliably?
- How does the system communicate tradeoffs when volume constraints prevent achieving Delta E ‚â§ 2.0?
- How does the system optimize formulas when multiple paint combinations achieve similar Delta E values?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST achieve Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 between target color and calculated mixed result for all feasible color matches
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow asymmetric paint volume ratios, where each paint can contribute different volumes to optimize accuracy
- **FR-003**: System MUST calculate individual paint volumes to milliliter precision for accurate measurement and mixing
- **FR-004**: System MUST attempt optimization up to Delta E ‚â§ 4.0 when Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 cannot be achieved, then clearly indicate the best achievable Delta E value and provide the closest possible match
- **FR-005**: System MUST optimize mixing formulas to prefer solutions with fewer total paint colors when multiple formulas achieve similar accuracy
- **FR-006**: System MUST assume all paint colors are always available for mixing calculations
- **FR-007**: System MUST balance volume constraints with accuracy requirements, clearly communicating tradeoffs when constraints conflict with achieving Delta E ‚â§ 2.0
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve existing color matching functionality while upgrading accuracy thresholds from current Delta E ‚â§ 4.0 to ‚â§ 2.0
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to compare current formula accuracy against enhanced accuracy options
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain mixing formula reproducibility, providing consistent results for identical input parameters
- **FR-011**: System MUST warn users when any individual paint volume falls below 5.0ml and suggest alternative approaches or volume scaling

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Enhanced Mixing Formula**: Represents optimized paint combinations with asymmetric volume ratios, target Delta E ‚â§ 2.0, individual paint volumes to milliliter precision, and accuracy validation metrics
- **Precision Volume Calculation**: Contains milliliter-precise measurements for each paint component, total volume constraints, minimum measurable quantities, and practical mixing guidelines
- **Accuracy Optimization Engine**: Manages the enhanced color matching algorithms, Delta E validation, formula comparison logic, and fallback strategies for unachievable targets

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: When the system cannot achieve Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 for a target color, what specific threshold should trigger the fallback behavior? ‚Üí A: Always attempt optimization up to 4.0 Delta E before showing fallback
- Q: What is the minimum practical paint volume threshold below which the system should warn users or suggest alternative approaches? ‚Üí A: 5.0ml - practical minimum for most paint mixing scenarios
- Q: How should the system handle paint inventory availability when calculating optimal formulas? ‚Üí A: Don't worry about availability, every paint is always available
- Q: When total volume constraints conflict with achieving Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 accuracy, what should the system prioritize? ‚Üí A: Try to balance both with clear tradeoff communication
