# Feature Specification: Paint Mixing Color App

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a paint mixing color app that will take a predefined set of colors defined in a JSON file that are actual paint colors. And I want to be able to do a few major things. One, I'd like to be able to input a new color, either through a hex code, a color picker, or an upload of an image, and have the app tell me the mixing ratio of the predefined colors in milliliters that will produce something as close as possible to the color that I defined via a hex code, a color picker, or an upload of an image. The second thing I'd like the app to do is, given a mixing ratio of milliliters of my predefined colors, I'd like for the app to tell me what the resultant output color is if I mix those paints in that ratio of milliliters. What color could I expect from that mixing ratio? I'd like to be able to then store for future reference these runs of the app so that I can recall a mixing ratio and a color combination that I have inputted before. I'd like those date and time stamped, and I'd also like to be able to put a label or name on those runs that I can recall later."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What type of paints are you working with? ‚Üí A: Oil paints (thick, complex mixing properties)
- Q: What level of color matching accuracy is acceptable for your use case? ‚Üí A: Commercial printing standard (Delta E ‚â§ 4.0, barely perceptible)
- Q: What are the practical mixing volume limits for your use case? ‚Üí A: 100-1000ml
- Q: Where should mixing session data be stored? ‚Üí A: Cloud storage that is part of the app - we will get to specifics later, but it will be Supabase
- Q: How should the system respond when target colors cannot be achieved with available paints? ‚Üí A: A and C

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Artists and paint mixing professionals need to accurately mix physical paints to achieve specific target colors. They want to input a desired color through various methods (hex codes, color picker, or image samples) and receive precise mixing ratios in milliliters using their available paint inventory. They also need to predict what color will result from specific mixing ratios and save successful formulations for future reference.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a target color input via hex code, **When** user requests mixing ratio, **Then** system provides milliliter measurements of predefined paints that create the closest possible match
2. **Given** specific milliliter amounts of predefined paints, **When** user requests color prediction, **Then** system shows the resulting color that would be produced by mixing those amounts
3. **Given** a successful mixing session, **When** user saves the session with a custom label, **Then** system stores the session with timestamp and allows future recall by label or date
4. **Given** an uploaded image, **When** user selects a color from the image, **Then** system extracts the color and provides mixing ratios as if input via hex code
5. **Given** saved mixing sessions, **When** user searches for previous sessions, **Then** system displays sessions with labels, dates, and mixing details

### Edge Cases & Error Handling
- **Unachievable Colors**: When target colors cannot be matched within Delta E ‚â§ 4.0, display actual Delta E value, closest achievable color swatch, and 3 alternative approaches with clear labels
- **Image Processing**: For uploaded images, require user to click specific pixel coordinates; display crosshair cursor and color preview before confirming selection
- **Invalid Input**: For invalid hex codes, display real-time validation with format examples (#FF5733); for extreme color values outside printable gamut, show warning with nearest printable equivalent
- **Insufficient Volume**: When recommended ratios exceed available paint inventory, scale down proportionally and display adjusted total volume with warning message

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST load predefined paint colors from a JSON configuration file containing color names and color values
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept target color input via hex code entry
- **FR-003**: System MUST accept target color input via interactive color picker
- **FR-004**: System MUST accept target color input via image upload with color selection capability
- **FR-005**: System MUST calculate mixing ratios in milliliters that produce the closest possible match to target color using available predefined paints, and when exact matches are impossible, provide closest achievable color with accuracy rating plus up to 3 alternative mixing approaches ranked by: (1) cost optimization (fewer expensive pigments), (2) simplicity (fewer total paints), and (3) accuracy optimization (best Delta E even if more complex)
- **FR-006**: System MUST accept user input of specific milliliter amounts for each predefined paint
- **FR-007**: System MUST predict and display the resulting color when given specific mixing ratios
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to save mixing sessions with custom labels for future reference
- **FR-009**: System MUST timestamp all saved mixing sessions automatically
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow users to recall and view previously saved mixing sessions
- **FR-011**: System MUST display color accuracy and achieve commercial printing standard with Delta E ‚â§ 4.0 (barely perceptible difference) between target and achievable colors
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle oil paint mixing behavior using Kubelka-Munk theory with the following measurable properties: opacity (0-1 scale where 0=transparent, 1=opaque), tinting strength (0-1 relative mixing power), pigment density (grams per milliliter), and absorption/scattering coefficients (K/S ratios) for accurate subtractive color mixing calculations
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate input ranges with minimum 100ml and maximum 1000ml per color in mixing ratios, and accept standard hex code formats (#RRGGBB and #RGB)
- **FR-014**: System MUST persist saved sessions in integrated cloud storage, enabling cross-device access and data synchronization

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Predefined Paint Color**: Represents actual physical paint with name, color value, and mixing properties
- **Mixing Session**: Represents a complete mixing calculation with input color, recommended ratios, actual ratios used, and user label
- **Target Color**: Represents desired color input through various methods (hex, picker, image)
- **Mixing Formula**: Represents calculated milliliter ratios for achieving target colors
- **Color Match Result**: Represents the calculated closest achievable color and its accuracy rating
