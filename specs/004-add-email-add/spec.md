# Feature Specification: Email/Password Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `004-add-email-add`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "add-email add the ability to log in via an email that is set up through the supabase Authentication and allow a login via email and password on the authentication page of the app. do not allow a user to self-register to login via email, only users that are set up via supabase console can log in via email"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Feature description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: email/password authentication, admin-only user provisioning, sign-in page
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: Clear user workflows identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí SUCCESS: User credentials entity identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Contains [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
8. Return: WARN "Spec has uncertainties - clarification needed"
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: How should the system handle multiple failed login attempts? ‚Üí A: Temporary account lockout - lock account for 15-30 minutes after 5 failed attempts
- Q: What happens if a user's email/password account is disabled by an administrator? ‚Üí A: Show generic error message - "Invalid credentials" (same as incorrect password for security)
- Q: How should the system handle password reset requests? ‚Üí A: Admin-only reset - only administrators can reset passwords through backend
- Q: Can the same email address have both OAuth and email/password credentials? ‚Üí A: OAuth takes precedence - if OAuth exists for email, email/password authentication is blocked
- Q: How should the system handle case sensitivity in email addresses during login? ‚Üí A: Case-insensitive - treat all email variations as the same (normalize to lowercase)
- Q: What is the acceptable response time for email/password authentication? ‚Üí A: Under 5 seconds - acceptable for authentication flows
- Q: What is the session duration/expiry policy for authenticated users? ‚Üí A: Match OAuth - use same session duration as existing OAuth authentication
- Q: Should the system provide minimum password strength requirements? ‚Üí A: no

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Pre-authorized users need the ability to sign into the PaintMixr application using their email address and password as an alternative to OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft, Facebook). Only administrators can create these email-based accounts through the backend system; users cannot self-register. This provides a simpler authentication option for users who prefer not to use third-party OAuth providers or may not have access to those services.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has been provisioned with email/password credentials by an administrator, **When** they navigate to the sign-in page and enter their valid email and password, **Then** they are successfully authenticated and redirected to the main application dashboard
2. **Given** a user enters an incorrect password, **When** they attempt to sign in, **Then** they see an error message indicating invalid credentials and remain on the sign-in page
3. **Given** a user enters an email address that does not exist in the system, **When** they attempt to sign in, **Then** they see an error message indicating invalid credentials
4. **Given** an authenticated user is using the application, **When** they sign out, **Then** they are redirected to the sign-in page and must re-authenticate to access the application
5. **Given** a new user without provisioned credentials, **When** they visit the sign-in page, **Then** they see no option to create a new account or register

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user enters an email in invalid format (e.g., missing @, no domain)?
- System locks account temporarily (15-30 minutes) after 5 consecutive failed login attempts to prevent brute force attacks
- Disabled accounts show generic "Invalid credentials" error message (same as incorrect password) to prevent account enumeration
- Password resets are admin-only; users cannot request password resets through the application interface
- If an email address already has OAuth authentication, email/password authentication is blocked for that email
- Email addresses are case-insensitive; "User@Example.com" and "user@example.com" are treated as the same account

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display an email/password sign-in option on the authentication page alongside existing OAuth provider buttons
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate email format before attempting authentication (standard email format validation)
- **FR-015**: System MUST treat email addresses as case-insensitive, normalizing all emails to lowercase for comparison and storage
- **FR-003**: System MUST authenticate users with valid email/password credentials provisioned through the admin backend
- **FR-004**: System MUST reject authentication attempts for email addresses not provisioned in the system
- **FR-005**: System MUST reject authentication attempts with incorrect passwords
- **FR-006**: System MUST display generic "Invalid credentials" error message for all authentication failures (incorrect password, non-existent email, or disabled account) to prevent user enumeration
- **FR-007**: System MUST NOT provide any user-facing interface for self-registration via email/password
- **FR-008**: System MUST NOT display "Create Account", "Sign Up", or similar links for email/password authentication
- **FR-013**: System MUST NOT provide any user-facing password reset functionality; password resets are administrator-only operations
- **FR-014**: System MUST block email/password authentication attempts for email addresses that already have OAuth authentication configured (OAuth takes precedence)
- **FR-009**: System MUST treat email/password authentication with the same session management and authorization as OAuth-based authentication
- **FR-010**: System MUST redirect successfully authenticated users to the main application dashboard
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain authentication state across page refreshes and browser sessions using the same session duration policy as OAuth authentication
- **FR-012**: System MUST support sign-out functionality that terminates the email/password authenticated session

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Email/password authentication MUST complete within 5 seconds from submission to completion (success or error response)
- **NFR-002**: System MUST implement temporary account lockout after 5 consecutive failed login attempts, locking the account for 15-30 minutes to protect against brute force attacks
- **NFR-003**: Passwords MUST be stored securely using industry-standard hashing (no minimum password strength requirements enforced)
- **NFR-004**: Authentication errors MUST NOT reveal whether an email exists in the system (prevent user enumeration)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Credential**: Represents an email/password authentication record for a user, containing email address (unique identifier), hashed password, account status (active/disabled), creation timestamp, and last login timestamp. Only administrators can create, modify, or delete these credentials.
- **Authentication Session**: Represents an active user session after successful email/password login, containing user identifier, session token, creation time, and expiry time.

### Dependencies & Assumptions
- **Dependency**: Authentication backend system already exists and supports email/password credential storage
- **Dependency**: Administrator interface exists for provisioning email/password accounts
- **Assumption**: Current OAuth authentication infrastructure can coexist with email/password authentication
- **Assumption**: Backend authentication system handles password hashing and security
- **Assumption**: Existing session management works for both OAuth and email/password authentication methods
