# Tasks: Email/Password Authentication

**Input**: Design documents from `/home/davistroy/dev/paintmixr/specs/004-add-email-add/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/auth-endpoints.md, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → SUCCESS: Next.js + Supabase Auth implementation
   → Tech stack: TypeScript 5.9.2, Next.js 14, React 18, Supabase Auth
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Auth entities (uses existing Supabase tables)
   → contracts/: POST /api/auth/email-signin endpoint
   → research.md: Supabase best practices, rate limiting, auth hooks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Type definitions, validation schemas
   → Tests: Contract tests, E2E tests, accessibility tests
   → Core: Form component, API route, Supabase wrappers
   → Integration: Sign-in page modification, auth hook deployment
   → Polish: Unit tests, performance validation, documentation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P] marker)
   → Tests before implementation (TDD mandatory)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T024)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → ✓ Contract has test (POST /api/auth/email-signin)
   → ✓ All components have tests
   → ✓ All tests before implementation
9. Return: SUCCESS (24 tasks ready for execution)
```

## Format: `[ID] [P?] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions
- **[TDD]**: Test-Driven Development - write failing test first

## Path Conventions
Next.js App Router with src/ directory structure:
- **Components**: `src/components/auth/`
- **API Routes**: `src/app/api/auth/`
- **Lib/Utils**: `src/lib/auth/`, `src/types/`
- **Tests**: `tests/`, `cypress/e2e/`

---

## Phase 3.1: Setup

- [X] **T001** [P] Create auth type definitions in `src/types/auth.ts`
  - EmailSigninInput interface
  - EmailSigninResponse interface
  - LockoutMetadata interface
  - LocalLockoutState interface
  - Export all types for use in components and API routes

- [X] **T002** [P] Create Zod validation schemas in `src/lib/auth/validation.ts`
  - emailSigninSchema with email and password validation
  - Email: lowercase transform, format validation, 255 char max
  - Password: required, min 1 char (no max or complexity per requirements)
  - Export schema and inferred type

- [X] **T003** [P] Create rate limiting utilities in `src/lib/auth/rate-limit.ts`
  - checkLocalLockout(email): Check localStorage for lockout state
  - updateLocalLockout(email): Increment failed attempts, set lockout if >= 5
  - clearLocalLockout(email): Reset counters on successful signin
  - Use localStorage for client-side immediate feedback

---

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ⚠️ MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3
**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

- [ ] **T004** [P] [TDD] Contract test POST /api/auth/email-signin success in `tests/integration/auth-signin.test.ts`
  - Test valid email/password returns { success: true, redirectUrl }
  - Test session cookie is set
  - Test response time < 5 seconds (NFR-001)
  - Mock Supabase signInWithPassword to return success
  - **Must fail initially** - API route doesn't exist yet

- [ ] **T005** [P] [TDD] Contract test POST /api/auth/email-signin errors in `tests/integration/auth-signin-errors.test.ts`
  - Test invalid credentials returns generic error "Invalid credentials"
  - Test validation errors return 400 with field details
  - Test server errors return 500 with generic message
  - Test lockout enforcement (5 attempts → error)
  - Test OAuth precedence (OAuth user → error)
  - **Must fail initially** - API route doesn't exist yet

- [ ] **T006** [P] [TDD] Unit test Zod email validation in `tests/unit/validation.test.ts`
  - Test valid email passes
  - Test invalid email format fails
  - Test email too long (> 255) fails
  - Test email normalization (uppercase → lowercase)
  - Test missing email/password fails
  - **Must fail initially** - validation schema doesn't exist yet

- [ ] **T007** [P] [TDD] Unit test rate limiting logic in `tests/unit/rate-limit.test.ts`
  - Test 4 failed attempts → no lockout
  - Test 5 failed attempts → lockout set for 15 min
  - Test lockout expired → allows attempt
  - Test lockout active → blocks attempt
  - Test successful signin → clears lockout
  - **Must fail initially** - rate limit functions don't exist yet

- [ ] **T008** [P] [TDD] Component test EmailPasswordForm in `tests/components/EmailPasswordForm.test.tsx`
  - Test form renders email and password inputs
  - Test form submission calls API with correct data
  - Test validation errors display correctly
  - Test lockout message displays when locked
  - Test submit button disabled during submission
  - Test accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
  - **Must fail initially** - component doesn't exist yet

- [ ] **T009** [P] [TDD] E2E test email signin flow in `cypress/e2e/email-auth.cy.ts`
  - Test successful signin → redirects to dashboard
  - Test invalid password → shows error, stays on signin page
  - Test 5 failed attempts → lockout message, button disabled
  - Test session persists across page refresh
  - Test signout → redirects to signin page
  - **Must fail initially** - full flow not implemented yet

- [ ] **T010** [P] [TDD] Accessibility test signin page in `tests/accessibility/signin-page.test.ts`
  - Test WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with jest-axe
  - Test color contrast >= 4.5:1 for text
  - Test keyboard navigation works
  - Test screen reader labels present
  - Test touch targets >= 44px

  - Test signin completes within 5 seconds (NFR-001)
  - Test UI interactions at 60fps
  - Establish performance baseline
  - Set up regression detection
  - **Must fail initially** - API route doesn't exist yet

---

## Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (ONLY after tests are failing)

- [X] **T012** [P] Implement EmailPasswordForm component in `src/components/auth/EmailSigninForm.tsx`
  - Use react-hook-form with zodResolver
  - Email and password inputs with proper labels
  - Loading state during submission
  - Error display with aria-live announcements
  - Lockout countdown timer when locked
  - Call /api/auth/email-signin on submit
  - Handle success (redirect) and error (display)
  - Integrate checkLocalLockout and updateLocalLockout
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (4.5:1 contrast, keyboard nav, ARIA labels)

- [X] **T013** Create server-side API route in `src/app/api/auth/email-signin/route.ts`
  - Parse and validate request body with Zod schema
  - Check lockout metadata from auth.users.raw_user_meta_data
  - Check OAuth precedence via auth.identities query
  - Call supabase.auth.signInWithPassword() if validation passes
  - On success: Reset lockout metadata, return { success: true, redirectUrl: '/' }
  - On error: Increment failed_login_attempts, set lockout_until if >= 5, return generic error
  - Handle validation errors (400) and server errors (500)
  - Implements all requirements from contracts/auth-endpoints.md

- [ ] **T014** [P] Add signInWithEmailPassword wrapper in `src/lib/auth/supabase-client.ts`
  - Create wrapper function that calls /api/auth/email-signin (not direct Supabase)
  - Returns { success: boolean, redirectUrl?: string, error?: string }
  - Used by EmailPasswordForm component
  - Note: Server-side validation happens in API route, not client-side

- [ ] **T015** [P] Create lockout metadata helpers in `src/lib/auth/metadata-helpers.ts`
  - incrementFailedAttempts(email): Update raw_user_meta_data
  - resetFailedAttempts(email): Clear lockout fields
  - checkLockoutStatus(email): Query and validate lockout_until
  - Use Supabase Admin API for metadata updates
  - Called from API route on signin success/failure

---

## Phase 3.4: Integration

- [X] **T016** Modify signin page to include email form in `src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx`
  - Add "Or continue with email" divider after OAuth buttons
  - Import and render EmailPasswordForm component
  - Pass redirectTo param from searchParams
  - Add error codes: account_locked, oauth_precedence
  - Update getErrorMessage() function
  - Maintain existing OAuth button functionality

- [X] **T017** Deploy Supabase auth hook to block signups
  - Create Postgres function `public.block_email_password_signup()`
  - Function rejects email/password signups, allows OAuth signups
  - Trigger configured on auth.users table (BEFORE INSERT)
  - Migration applied: block_email_password_signup
  - Verified: Trigger active and enabled

- [X] **T018** Create admin user provisioning documentation in `docs/admin-user-creation.md`
  - Steps for creating email/password users via Supabase Console
  - Alternative: Admin API code example
  - Security best practices for password selection
  - Troubleshooting common issues
  - Link from main README

## Dependencies

### Sequential Dependencies (blocking)
```
Setup Phase:
  T001, T002, T003 → All independent [P]

Test Phase (all parallel):
  T004, T005, T006, T007, T008, T009, T010, T011 → All [P]
  Tests MUST fail before proceeding to implementation

Implementation Phase:
  T012 (EmailPasswordForm) ← depends on T002 (validation schema)
  T013 (API route) ← depends on T002 (validation schema), T015 (metadata helpers)
  T014 (Supabase wrapper) ← independent [P]
  T015 (Metadata helpers) ← independent [P]

Integration Phase:
  T016 (Signin page) ← depends on T012 (EmailPasswordForm component)
  T017 (Auth hook) ← independent (Supabase deployment)
  T018 (Documentation) ← independent [P]

Polish Phase:
  T019, T020, T021, T022, T023 ← depend on T012-T017 complete
  T024 (CLAUDE.md) ← independent [P]
```

### Critical Path
```
T002 (validation) → T013 (API route) → T016 (signin page) → T021 (E2E tests)
T002 (validation) → T012 (form component) → T016 (signin page) → T021 (E2E tests)
```

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
```
Phase 3.1: T001, T002, T003 in parallel (different files)
Phase 3.2: T004-T011 in parallel (all test files)
Phase 3.3: T012, T014, T015 in parallel (after T002 complete)
Phase 3.5: T019, T020, T021, T022, T023, T024 in parallel
```

## Notes

### Test-First Development (TDD)
- **CRITICAL**: Complete Phase 3.2 (T004-T011) BEFORE Phase 3.3
- All tests must FAIL initially (red phase)
- Implement code to make tests pass (green phase)
- Refactor if needed while keeping tests passing

### Parallel Execution ([P] marker)
- [P] tasks touch different files with no shared dependencies
- Can be executed simultaneously by different agents/workers
- Non-[P] tasks may modify same file or have sequential dependencies

### File Modification Conflicts
- T013 and T016 both modify authentication flow → run sequentially
- T002 must complete before T012, T013 (validation dependency)
- T012 must complete before T016 (component integration)

### Constitutional Compliance
- ✅ Test-First Development: Tests in Phase 3.2 before impl in Phase 3.3
- ✅ Type Safety: T001, T002 provide TypeScript types and Zod schemas
- ✅ Accessibility: T010, T022 ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- ✅ Performance: T011, T023 validate < 5 second response time
- ✅ Security: Generic errors, rate limiting, server-side validation

### Commit Strategy
- Commit after each task completion
- Use task ID in commit message: `feat: T012 - Implement EmailPasswordForm component`
- Squash commits when merging feature branch
