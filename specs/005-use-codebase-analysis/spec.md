## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-02
- Q: What is the target deployment environment for this application? ‚Üí A: Single-region cloud (Vercel/similar) with managed services, no custom infrastructure
- Q: What is the minimum acceptable uptime/availability for this application? ‚Üí A: Best-effort (95-98% uptime, occasional downtime acceptable during maintenance)
- Q: What is the minimum acceptable test coverage percentage for critical code paths? ‚Üí A: 90%+ coverage (exhaustive, all branches and conditions)
- Q: What is the expected maximum concurrent user count the system must support? ‚Üí A: 100-500 concurrent users (small application, light load)
- Q: What is the expected response time for addressing newly discovered security vulnerabilities? ‚Üí A: Proactive monitoring only, reactive fixes on case-by-case basis
- Q: Must phases be completed strictly in sequence (1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4), or can work proceed in parallel across phases? ‚Üí A: Parallel with dependencies (Independent tasks from later phases can start early)
- Q: How should code duplication reduction be measured for the 40-50% target? ‚Üí A: Token-based similarity - AST analysis of duplicate patterns
- Q: Are TypeScript error suppressions (@ts-expect-error, @ts-ignore) allowed in the codebase after strict mode is enabled? ‚Üí A: Liberal use allowed - for third-party library issues and edge cases
- Q: What rate limiting window strategy should be used? ‚Üí A: Sliding window (continuous tracking, smoother rate enforcement)
- Q: What happens if a user attempts login during an active lockout period? ‚Üí A: Lockout timer resets to full 15 minutes (punitive for persistent attempts)
- Q: How should large components be split to meet the 300-line target? ‚Üí A: Both strategies allowed (component and function extraction as appropriate)
- Q: How should migration from legacy Supabase clients be handled for existing code? ‚Üí A: Breaking change acceptable - update all consumers in one phase
- Q: What does the "under 2 seconds" authentication response time requirement measure? ‚Üí A: Server-side with reasonable network assumption (e.g., <200ms latency budget)
- Q: How long should rate limit and lockout metadata be retained after expiry? ‚Üí A: use the simplest approach
- Q: What should happen to placeholder TDD tests that were never implemented? ‚Üí A: Convert to .skip() with TODO comments - temporarily disabled but documented

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a **development team** maintaining the PaintMixr application, we need to eliminate critical security vulnerabilities, improve code quality, and reduce technical debt so that the application is production-ready, maintainable, and can safely scale to thousands of users without security risks or performance degradation.

**Implementation Approach**: Work proceeds through four phases (Phase 1: Critical Security & Performance, Phase 2: Type Safety & Pattern Consolidation, Phase 3: Code Reuse & Maintainability, Phase 4: Testing & Code Quality) with parallel execution allowed for independent tasks across phases as long as dependencies are respected.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Phase 1: Critical Security & Performance Fixes
1. **Given** the system has 10,000 registered users, **When** a user attempts to sign in with email/password, **Then** the authentication response time must be under 2 seconds (not linearly increasing with user count)

2. **Given** an attacker sends 100 rapid login attempts, **When** the system receives these requests, **Then** the system must rate-limit after the configured threshold and return 429 status codes without exhausting server resources

3. **Given** a user account has both OAuth (Google) and email/password credentials linked, **When** the user attempts email/password login, **Then** the system must correctly identify the OAuth precedence and return appropriate error message

4. **Given** 5 concurrent failed login attempts for the same user, **When** the lockout counter is incremented, **Then** the user account must be locked after exactly 5 attempts (no race condition allowing 6+ attempts)

4a. **Given** a user account is locked due to failed attempts, **When** the user attempts login during the lockout period, **Then** the lockout timer must reset to full 15 minutes from the new attempt

5. **Given** the codebase needs to upgrade to Next.js 15, **When** developers run the build with Next.js 15, **Then** all pages with `searchParams` must work without runtime errors

#### Phase 2: Type Safety & Pattern Consolidation
6. **Given** developers write code using shared types, **When** they import type definitions, **Then** there must be a single canonical source for each type with no conflicting duplicate definitions

7. **Given** TypeScript strict mode is enabled, **When** developers compile the codebase, **Then** null/undefined access bugs, implicit any types, and uninitialized properties must be caught at compile-time

8. **Given** developers need to create a Supabase client, **When** they look for client implementations, **Then** they must find exactly one modern pattern per context (browser, server component, API route) with no legacy alternatives

#### Phase 3: Code Reuse & Maintainability
9. **Given** multiple components need to make API calls, **When** developers write fetch logic, **Then** they must use a shared API client utility with consistent error handling

10. **Given** the codebase contains large components (>500 lines), **When** developers need to modify functionality, **Then** components must be split into focused, testable units under 300 lines each

11. **Given** multiple components need pagination or filtering, **When** developers implement these features, **Then** they must use shared hooks/utilities instead of duplicating logic

#### Phase 4: Testing & Code Quality
12. **Given** new features are added to the codebase, **When** developers run the test suite, **Then** all tests must pass with meaningful assertions (no placeholder tests left as false positives)

13. **Given** code changes are committed, **When** CI/CD runs, **Then** build configuration must not ignore TypeScript or ESLint errors

### Edge Cases
- **What happens when** type definitions are incompatible across modules? ‚Üí Must identify and rename domain-specific versions to prevent runtime errors
- **How does system handle** N+1 queries when user count grows? ‚Üí Must use targeted queries with `.eq()` filters instead of fetching all records
- **What happens when** developers import legacy Supabase clients? ‚Üí Legacy files must be deleted; build errors guide migration to modern patterns
- **How does system handle** concurrent metadata updates? ‚Üí Must use atomic database operations instead of read-modify-write patterns
- **What happens when** strict mode reveals 100+ type errors? ‚Üí Must fix incrementally by category (null checks, implicit any, function types, uninitialized properties)
