## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT needs to be fixed and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a PaintMixr user, I need the Enhanced Accuracy Mode to work correctly so that I can access professional-grade color matching with Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 accuracy. When I enable this mode and enter a color, the system should successfully calculate an optimized paint formula instead of showing an error message.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Issue #1: Enhanced Accuracy Mode Authentication Fix
1. **Given** user is signed in and viewing the color matching dashboard
   **When** user enables Enhanced Accuracy Mode checkbox and enters a hex color
   **Then** system successfully calculates optimized formula without showing "API error: 401"

2. **Given** Enhanced Accuracy Mode is enabled
   **When** user enters any valid color (hex, color picker, or image)
   **Then** system returns a color formula with Delta E ‚â§ 2.0 (or best achievable accuracy)

3. **Given** user session has expired
   **When** user attempts to use Enhanced Accuracy Mode
   **Then** system redirects to login page with clear message about session expiration

#### Issue #2: Session Save UX Feedback
1. **Given** user has calculated a paint formula
   **When** user fills in session name and clicks "Save Session"
   **Then** system shows success message and closes the save dialog automatically

2. **Given** user successfully saves a session
   **When** save completes
   **Then** system displays confirmation message (e.g., "Session saved successfully")

3. **Given** session save fails for any reason
   **When** error occurs
   **Then** system shows user-friendly error message (not technical HTTP codes)

#### Issue #3: Session Detail Navigation (Lower Priority)
1. **Given** user is viewing session history
   **When** user clicks on a saved session card
   **Then** system navigates to session detail view within 2 seconds

2. **Given** session detail view is not implemented
   **When** user clicks session card
   **Then** system shows message "Session details coming soon" instead of timing out

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Enhanced Accuracy Mode request takes longer than expected?
  - System should show loading indicator and allow cancellation
- How does system handle intermittent authentication failures?
  - System should retry once, then show clear error message
- What if session save partially succeeds (session created but formula fails)?
  - System should handle atomically or show which parts succeeded/failed

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Enhanced Accuracy Mode Authentication (Critical Priority)
- **FR-001**: System MUST successfully authenticate users when Enhanced Accuracy Mode is enabled
- **FR-002**: System MUST calculate optimized color formulas when Enhanced Accuracy Mode is active
- **FR-003**: System MUST NOT display "API error: 401" or other technical error codes to users
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle authentication errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

#### Session Save UX Improvements (Medium Priority)
- **FR-005**: System MUST display success confirmation message after session save completes
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically close the save dialog after successful save
- **FR-007**: System MUST show user-friendly error messages for save failures (avoid "500 error", "401 unauthorized")
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide visual feedback during save operation (loading state)

#### Session Detail Navigation (Low Priority)
- **FR-009**: System MUST navigate to session detail view within 2 seconds when user clicks session card
- **FR-010**: System MUST show appropriate message if session detail feature is not yet implemented
- **FR-011**: System MUST NOT timeout or hang when user clicks session cards

#### Error Handling Standards (All Fixes)
- **FR-012**: System MUST translate all HTTP error codes to user-friendly messages
- **FR-013**: System MUST distinguish between user errors (invalid input) and system errors (authentication, database)
- **FR-014**: System MUST log technical errors for debugging while showing simple messages to users

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: Enhanced Accuracy Mode must maintain existing performance targets (‚â§10 seconds calculation)
- **NFR-002**: Error messages must be understandable to non-technical users
- **NFR-003**: All fixes must not break existing working functionality
- **NFR-004**: User experience should feel seamless (no jarring error screens or unexplained failures)

### Key Entities
- **Error Message**: User-friendly text shown when operations fail, with optional details for debugging
- **Session Save Feedback**: Visual confirmation (toast/banner) shown after save operations complete or fail
- **Loading State**: Visual indicator shown during async operations (formula calculation, session save)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-03

**Q1: Success Message Display Pattern**
Based on codebase analysis, no toast notification system currently exists. Standard UX pattern adopted: Toast notification library (shadcn/ui Toast component) at top-right of screen, auto-dismiss after 3 seconds, with manual dismiss option.

**Q2: Error Message Translation**
Technical HTTP errors (401, 500) will be translated to user-friendly messages:
- 401 Unauthorized ‚Üí "Session expired. Please sign in again."
- 500 Internal Server Error ‚Üí "Unable to complete request. Please try again."
- Network failures ‚Üí "Connection issue. Please check your internet connection."

**Q3: Enhanced Accuracy Mode Loading Behavior**
During optimization calculation (which may take up to 10 seconds per NFR-001):
- Display loading spinner on "Calculate Formula" button
- Show progress text: "Optimizing formula for enhanced accuracy..."
- Allow cancellation via ESC key or Cancel button
- Timeout after 15 seconds with retry option

**Q4: Session Detail Navigation**
Session detail view is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. For this bug fix feature:
- Clicking session card will show toast: "Session details view coming soon"
- No timeout/hang behavior (current issue)
- Implementation of full detail view is out of scope (would be a new feature)

**Q5: Dialog Auto-Close Timing**
After successful session save and success toast display:
- Wait 500ms (allow user to see success toast)
- Close save dialog automatically
- User remains on current page with updated session history

**Q6: Retry Logic for Authentication Failures**
For Enhanced Accuracy Mode 401 errors specifically:
- Single automatic retry after 500ms delay
- If retry fails, redirect to /auth/signin with query param `?reason=session_expired`
- Show message on signin page: "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."

## Additional Context

### Issues Identified from COMPREHENSIVE_E2E_TEST_REPORT.md

**Issue #1: Enhanced Accuracy Mode - 401 Unauthorized Error** (HIGH severity)
- Root cause: Authentication endpoint using wrong client type
- Impact: Professional-grade color matching completely broken
- User experience: Cryptic "API error: 401" message displayed
- Priority: CRITICAL - blocks key feature advertised as "Target ŒîE ‚â§ 2.0"

**Issue #2: Session Save UX Feedback** (MEDIUM severity)
- Symptoms: No success message after save, dialog remains open
- Impact: Users unsure if save succeeded
- User experience: Confusing - must navigate away to verify save worked
- Priority: MEDIUM - degrades user confidence in the application

**Issue #3: Session Card Click Timeout** (LOW severity)
- Symptoms: Clicking session cards times out after 5 seconds
- Impact: Cannot view saved session details
- User experience: Feature appears broken but may not be fully implemented
- Priority: LOW - workaround exists (sessions still visible in list)

### Issues NOT in Scope (Test Report Noted, But Not Bugs)
- Ratio Prediction dropdown interaction (automated testing limitation, not a bug)
- Paint library management (feature not yet implemented - out of scope)
- Collection management (feature not yet implemented - out of scope)
- Additional input method testing (features working, just not fully tested)

### Success Metrics
- Enhanced Accuracy Mode authentication: 100% success rate for authenticated users
- Session save feedback: 100% of saves show clear success/failure message
- Error message clarity: 0 technical error codes (401, 500) shown to end users
- Session navigation: < 2 second response time or clear "not implemented" message
