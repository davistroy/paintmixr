## Color Science - Kubelka-Munk Mixing Theory Tests

**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Category**: Test Coverage

### Background

During Feature 005 (Codebase Analysis), a test file was created for Kubelka-Munk mixing theory (`src/lib/color-science/__tests__/kubelka-munk-enhanced.test.ts`) but the implementation was never completed. The test file caused CI/CD failures with 80+ TypeScript errors and was removed to restore pipeline functionality.

### What's Missing

Six functions are tested but not implemented:

1. **KubelkaMunkCalculator** - Core class for K-M calculations
2. **calculateMixtureColor** - Predict mixture color from paint ratios
3. **optimizeFormula** - Optimize paint mixing formulas
4. **validatePaintData** - Validate paint optical properties
5. **generateMixingReport** - Generate mixing instructions
6. **performQualityChecks** - Quality assurance for formulas

### Implementation Requirements

- Use Vitest syntax (not Jest)
- Export all functions from `/src/lib/color-science/kubelka-munk.ts`
- Follow strict TypeScript mode (no implicit any)
- Achieve 90%+ test coverage for critical paths
- Integration with existing color-science module

### Test Coverage Goals

- Unit tests: All K-M calculation functions
- Integration tests: End-to-end mixing workflows
- Edge cases: Invalid inputs, boundary conditions
- Performance tests: Large paint datasets

### References

- Removed test file: commit cd7f91b
- GitHub Actions failure: Run #18224505241
- Related: Constitutional Principle II (Color Science Accuracy)
- Related: Kubelka-Munk coefficients in paint database

### Suggested Approach

1. Implement core K-M calculation functions
2. Add optical properties to Paint type
3. Write unit tests following Vitest patterns
4. Validate against real-world paint mixing data
5. Document mathematical formulas and assumptions

### Dependencies

- Paint database with K-M coefficients
- Color science utilities (LAB, Delta E)
- Optimization algorithm framework
